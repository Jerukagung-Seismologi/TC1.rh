Made and tested with LibreCad Version: 2.1.3 - System: Windows

This is my first attempt of making a CAD-file...

Print this file to have a template for cutting and for drilling holes in:
* the plastic parts
* the wooden legs.

For printing with LibreCad select:
* File > Print Preview
* remove check at 'fixe' (Print Scale) and select >1:1<
