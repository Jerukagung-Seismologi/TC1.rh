# seismometer_TC1.rh.dxf

Made and tested with LibreCad (Version: 2.1.3 - Windows)

This is my first attempt of making a CAD-file...

Print this file and you will have a template for cutting and for drilling holes in:
* the plastic parts
* the wooden legs.

For printing with LibreCad select:
* File > Print Preview
* remove check at >'fixed'< (Print Scale) and select >1:1<
